    "Boosting is an ensemble machine learning technique that combines the predictions of multiple base models (typically weak learners) to create a stronger predictive model. It aims to improve predictive accuracy by focusing on the examples that previous models found difficult to classify correctly."

    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Boosting often yields high predictive accuracy, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.\n",
    "- It can handle a variety of data types, including categorical and numerical features.\n",
    "- Boosting algorithms automatically assign higher weights to misclassified examples, focusing on the most challenging cases.\n",
    "- They are less prone to overfitting compared to individual weak learners.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Boosting can be sensitive to noisy data and outliers, leading to reduced performance.\n",
    "- Training boosting models can be computationally expensive due to the sequential nature of the algorithm.\n",
    "- The potential for model selection (choosing the right boosting algorithm and hyperparameters) can be challenging."

    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting works by iteratively training a sequence of weak learners, where each new learner focuses on the examples that the previous learners found challenging. It combines their predictions to create a strong learner. The process involves assigning weights to the training examples. Examples that were misclassified by the previous learners are given higher weights, while correctly classified examples receive lower weights. This adaptive re-weighting ensures that the subsequent learners focus more on the misclassified instances. The final prediction is a weighted sum of the individual learner predictions."

The optimal number of estimators may vary depending on the specific dataset and problem."
