    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net Regression is a combination of Ridge and Lasso Regression, which uses both L2 and L1 penalties1. The optimal values of the regularization parameters for Elastic Net Regression are typically chosen using cross-validation\n",
    "\n",
    "In Elastic Net Regression, there are two regularization parameters that need to be chosen: alpha and lambda. Alpha controls the balance between the L1 and L2 penalties, with alpha = 0 corresponding to Ridge Regression (L2 penalty only) and alpha = 1 corresponding to Lasso Regression (L1 penalty only)2. Lambda controls the overall strength of the regularization."

    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Balances Lasso and Ridge: Elastic Net combines the strengths of both Lasso and Ridge Regression. It can handle high-dimensional datasets with multicollinearity while performing variable selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feature Selection: Like Lasso, Elastic Net can lead to sparse models by driving some coefficients to exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multicollinearity Handling: Similar to Ridge, Elastic Net can handle multicollinearity effectively by shrinking correlated coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stability: Elastic Net offers stability in situations where there are many correlated features and the Lasso might be unstable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Complexity: Elastic Net introduces an additional hyperparameter that needs to be tuned, making the model's optimization more complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Interpretation Complexity: Interpreting the model can become more complex as the combination of L1 and L2 regularization adds another layer of complexity to the coefficients' interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Computational Cost: Compared to simple linear regression, Elastic Net Regression can be computationally more expensive, especially when dealing with high-dimensional datasets.\n",

    "### Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "- Genomics and Bioinformatics: In genomics studies, where thousands of genes are analyzed, Elastic Net can effectively handle the multicollinearity and sparsity of gene expression data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Economics and Finance: In economics and finance, where there are often many correlated economic indicators or financial variables, Elastic Net can provide stable and interpretable models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Text Analysis: In natural language processing, where text data can result in high-dimensional feature spaces, Elastic Net can help handle feature selection and model complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Medical Research: In medical research, where there are often complex relationships between patient characteristics and outcomes, Elastic Net can assist in variable selection and model robustness."

    "### Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreting coefficients in Elastic Net Regression is similar to interpreting coefficients in linear regression, but the presence of both L1 and L2 regularization adds complexity. Here's a general approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A positive coefficient indicates a positive relationship between the predictor and the response variable, considering other variables constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A negative coefficient indicates a negative relationship between the predictor and the response variable, considering other variables constant.\n",

    "### Question 6\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling missing values in Elastic Net Regression is similar to handling them in traditional linear regression. Some common strategies include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Imputation: Impute missing values using techniques such as mean, median, mode imputation, or more advanced methods like K-nearest neighbors or regression imputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Deletion: If the missing values are minimal, you might consider removing the corresponding data points, but this should be done cautiously as it might lead to biased results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Advanced Methods: Consider advanced imputation methods like Multiple Imputation or using predictive models to estimate missing values based on the available data."
