    "Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble learning method in machine learning. It uses multiple decision trees to predict continuous (numeric) values. Each decision tree is constructed on a different subset of the training data using a technique called bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating), and the final prediction is made by aggregating the individual tree predictions."

    "\n",
    "Random Forest Regressor reduces overfitting by introducing diversity among the individual decision trees. It trains multiple trees on bootstrapped subsets of the data and features, and the final prediction is an average or weighted combination of these tree predictions. This ensemble approach helps smooth out the noise and reduce the variance that can lead to overfitting.\n"

    "Random Forest Regressor aggregates predictions through averaging in the case of regression tasks. Each tree in the ensemble produces a numeric prediction. These predictions are combined, usually by taking the mean or weighted mean of all the tree predictions, resulting in the final ensemble prediction."
