    "**Q1. What are Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors? How are they related to the Eigen-Decomposition approach? Explain with an example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are concepts in linear algebra. For a square matrix \\(A\\), a scalar \\(\\lambda\\) is an eigenvalue and a non-zero vector \\(v\\) is the corresponding eigenvector if \\(Av = \\lambda v\\). The Eigen-Decomposition of a matrix \\(A\\) is given by \\(A = PDP^{-1}\\), where \\(P\\) is a matrix of eigenvectors and \\(D\\) is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\\[ A = \\begin{bmatrix} 4 & 1 \\\\ 2 & 3 \\end{bmatrix} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "The eigenvalues (\\(\\lambda\\)) can be found by solving the characteristic equation \\(|A - \\lambda I| = 0\\), leading to \\(\\lambda_1 = 5\\) and \\(\\lambda_2 = 2\\). Corresponding eigenvectors can be found by solving \\((A - \\lambda_i I)v_i = 0\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. What is eigen decomposition and what is its significance in linear algebra?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Eigen decomposition is the factorization of a matrix into a canonical form, \\(A = PDP^{-1}\\), where \\(P\\) is a matrix of eigenvectors and \\(D\\) is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues. It's significant as it simplifies matrix operations, facilitates analysis, and reveals the behavior of linear transformations encoded in the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. What are the conditions that must be satisfied for a square matrix to be diagonalizable using the Eigen-Decomposition approach? Provide a brief proof to support your answer.**\n",
    "\n",
    "A square matrix is diagonalizable if it has \\(n\\) linearly independent eigenvectors. For \\(A\\) to be diagonalizable, the geometric multiplicity (number of eigenvectors for each eigenvalue) must equal the algebraic multiplicity (the power of \\((\\lambda - \\lambda_i)\\) in the characteristic polynomial).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. What is the significance of the spectral theorem in the context of the Eigen-Decomposition approach? How is it related to the diagonalizability of a matrix? Explain with an example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The spectral theorem states that for a symmetric matrix, the eigenvectors are orthogonal, and the matrix is diagonalizable. It ensures real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors. For instance, a symmetric matrix like \\(A = \\begin{bmatrix} 4 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 5 \\end{bmatrix}\\) is guaranteed to be diagonalizable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. How do you find the eigenvalues of a matrix and what do they represent?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation \\(|A - \\lambda I| = 0\\). They represent the scaling factor by which the eigenvectors are stretched or compressed during a linear transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6. What are eigenvectors and how are they related to eigenvalues?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Eigenvectors are non-zero vectors that, when transformed by a matrix, only change by a scalar factor, which is the eigenvalue associated with that eigenvector.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q7. Can you explain the geometric interpretation of eigenvectors and eigenvalues?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Eigenvectors define directions of stretching or compressing in a linear transformation, and eigenvalues represent the scaling factors along those directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q8. What are some real-world applications of eigen decomposition?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Eigen decomposition is used in Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, image compression, solving systems of differential equations, and in quantum mechanics for finding the allowed energy levels of a system.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q9. Can a matrix have more than one set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, a matrix can have multiple sets of linearly independent eigenvectors, each corresponding to different eigenvalues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q10. In what ways is the Eigen-Decomposition approach useful in data analysis and machine learning? Discuss at least three specific applications or techniques that rely on Eigen-Decomposition.**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Eigen decomposition is fundamental to PCA, a technique for dimensionality reduction. It helps identify the principal components, reducing data to a lower-dimensional space while retaining essential information.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Solving Linear Systems:** Eigen decomposition simplifies solving systems of linear equations. The diagonalized form allows for easy computation of matrix powers, exponentials, and inverses.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Graph Analysis and Connectivity:** Eigen decomposition is used in spectral graph theory, where the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices derived from graphs provide information about graph connectivity, clustering, and centrality."
