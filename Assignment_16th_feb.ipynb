    "SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational databases that use tables to store data. SQL databases have a pre-defined schema, and all data stored in the database must adhere to that schema. SQL databases are generally best suited for applications that require complex querying, transactions, and data consistency. Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL.\n",

    "NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are non-relational databases that do not use tables to store data. Instead, they use a variety of data models, such as key-value pairs, documents, and graphs. NoSQL databases are generally best suited for applications that require scalability, flexibility, and speed. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis."

    "DDL stands for Data Definition Language and is used to define the database schema or structure. It includes statements used to create, modify and delete database structures such as tables, indexes, views, sequences, and other related database objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The CREATE statement is used to create a new database object such as a table, index, or view. For example, the following statement creates a new table named \"users\": \n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE users (\n",
    "   id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "   name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "   email VARCHAR(100)\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  The DROP statement is used to delete a database object such as a table or view. For example, the following statement deletes the \"users\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP TABLE users;\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The ALTER statement is used to modify the structure of an existing database object. For example, the following statement adds a new column named \"phone\" to the \"users\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE users ADD phone VARCHAR(20);\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The TRUNCATE statement is used to delete all data from a table, but keeps the table structure intact. It is faster than the DELETE statement as it does not log individual row deletions. For example, the following statement deletes all data from the \"users\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE users;\n"
