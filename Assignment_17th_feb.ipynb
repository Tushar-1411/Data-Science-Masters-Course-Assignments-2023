    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL document database that uses a flexible JSON-like data model to store and retrieve data. It is designed for high availability, scalability, and performance, and is commonly used in modern web applications, data analytics, and IoT applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that do not use the traditional relational model of organizing data into tables with fixed schemas. Instead, NoSQL databases use a variety of data models, including document-oriented, key-value, graph, and column-family\n",
    "\n",
    "In scenarios where data is unstructured or semi-structured, and where high scalability and availability are important, MongoDB is often preferred over traditional SQL databases."

    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular NoSQL document-oriented database that offers several features and benefits to its users. Some of the key features of MongoDB are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Flexible data model: MongoDB uses a document-based data model that allows users to store data in a flexible schema. This means that users can easily add or modify fields in the document without affecting the entire database.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Scalability: MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally across multiple servers, allowing users to handle large amounts of data and high traffic loads with ease. It uses sharding to distribute data across multiple servers and replica sets to ensure data availability and durability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. High performance: MongoDB uses an in-memory caching system and indexes to provide high performance for read and write operations. It also supports ad hoc queries, aggregation, and MapReduce for advanced data processing."
