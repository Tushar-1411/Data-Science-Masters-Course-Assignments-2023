The standard method for calculating a confidence interval using bootstrap is as follows:\n",

    "1. Randomly draw a large number (B) of resamples from your original dataset. Each resample is the same size as your original dataset, and sampling is done with replacement. This generates B resampled datasets.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. To create a confidence interval, use the percentile method. Sort the B statistic values from step 2 in ascending order. Then, the lower bound of your confidence interval is the (100α/2)th percentile, and the upper bound is the (100(1 - α/2))th percentile, where α represents the significance level (e.g., 0.05 for a 95% confidence interval)."
