    "Q1. **Types of Clustering Algorithms:**\n",
    "   - **Hierarchical Clustering:** Forms a tree of clusters. Agglomerative starts with individual data points as clusters and merges them, while divisive starts with one cluster and splits.\n",
    "   - **K-Means Clustering:** Divides data into k clusters based on similarity.\n",
    "   - **Density-Based Clustering (DBSCAN):** Groups together data points that are close to each other and have a sufficient number of nearby neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. **K-Means Clustering:**\n",
    "   - **How it works:** Divides data into k clusters where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.\n",
    "   - **Algorithm:**\n",
    "     1. Randomly initialize k centroids.\n",
    "     2. Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.\n",
    "     3. Recalculate the centroids based on the assigned points.\n",
    "     4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. **Advantages and Limitations of K-Means:**\n",
    "   - **Advantages:**\n",
    "     - Simple and computationally efficient.\n",
    "     - Works well with large datasets.\n",
    "   - **Limitations:**\n",
    "     - Sensitive to initial centroid placement.\n",
    "     - Assumes clusters are spherical and equally sized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. **Determining Optimal Number of Clusters:**\n",
    "   - **Elbow Method:** Plotting the variance explained as a function of the number of clusters and looking for an \"elbow\" point.\n",
    "   - **Silhouette Method:** Measures how similar an object is to its cluster compared to other clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. **Applications of K-Means:**\n",
    "   - Image segmentation.\n",
    "   - Customer segmentation in marketing.\n",
    "   - Anomaly detection in cybersecurity.\n",
    "   - Document clustering in natural language processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. **Interpreting K-Means Output:**\n",
    "   - Each cluster represents a group of similar data points.\n",
    "   - Centroids are representative of the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. **Challenges in K-Means Clustering:**\n",
    "   - Sensitivity to initial centroids.\n",
    "   - Difficulty handling clusters of different sizes and densities.\n",
    "   - Works poorly with non-spherical clusters.\n"
