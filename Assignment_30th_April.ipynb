    "1. **Homogeneity and Completeness:**\n",
    "   - **Homogeneity:** Measures if all of its clusters contain only data points that are members of a single class. Calculated using entropy-based metrics.\n",
    "   - **Completeness:** Ensures that all members of a given class are assigned to the same cluster. Also calculated using entropy-based metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **V-measure:**\n",
    "   - A harmonic mean of homogeneity and completeness.\n",
    "   - \\( V = 2 \\cdot \\frac{{\\text{{homogeneity}} \\cdot \\text{{completeness}}}}{{\\text{{homogeneity}} + \\text{{completeness}}}} \\)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Silhouette Coefficient:**\n",
    "   - Measures how similar an object is to its own cluster (cohesion) compared to other clusters (separation).\n",
    "   - Range: [-1, 1]; higher values indicate better-defined clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Davies-Bouldin Index:**\n",
    "   - Represents the average similarity ratio of each cluster with the cluster that is most similar to it.\n",
    "   - Lower values indicate better clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Homogeneity vs. Completeness:**\n",
    "   - Yes, a clustering result can have high homogeneity and low completeness. For example, if each class is assigned to a separate cluster, homogeneity is high (each cluster is pure), but completeness is low (points of a class are scattered across different clusters).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **V-measure for Optimal Clusters:**\n",
    "   - V-measure can be used to compare clustering results with different numbers of clusters. The number of clusters with the highest V-measure can be considered optimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Silhouette Coefficient Pros and Cons:**\n",
    "   - *Advantages:* Simple interpretation, suitable for any algorithm.\n",
    "   - *Disadvantages:* Sensitive to noise and outliers, assumes convex clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Davies-Bouldin Index Limitations:**\n",
    "   - Assumes clusters as convex and isotropic, might not work well with non-convex clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Relationship Between Metrics:**\n",
    "   - They are interconnected; a perfect clustering result would have high values for all three.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Silhouette Coefficient for Algorithm Comparison:**\n",
    "    - It can be used to compare algorithms by evaluating the average Silhouette Coefficient across clusters. Watch out for varying cluster shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Davies-Bouldin Index Measures:**\n",
    "    - Measures the compactness and separation of clusters. Assumes clusters to be similar in size and shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Silhouette Coefficient for Hierarchical Clustering:**\n",
    "    - It can be applied to hierarchical clustering results, but the challenge lies in the definition of cluster shapes.\n",
