    "1. Probability Mass Function (PMF) is used to describe the probability distribution of a discrete random variable. It gives the probability of each possible outcome of the random variable. PMF is typically used for discrete random variables, such as the outcome of a coin toss or the number of occurrences of an event.\n",

It gives the probability density at each possible value of the random variable. PDF is typically used for continuous random variables, such as height or weight measurements.\n",

    "The difference between Bernoulli Distribution and Binomial Distribution is that Bernoulli Distribution represents a single trial of a binary event, whereas Binomial Distribution represents the number of successes (1s) in a fixed number of independent and identically distributed Bernoulli trials. In other words, Bernoulli Distribution is a special case of Binomial Distribution where the number of trials (n) is 1."
