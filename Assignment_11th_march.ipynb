    "T-test and z-test are both statistical tests used for hypothesis testing, but they are applied under different conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "T-test:\n",
    "1. A t-test is used when the sample size is small (typically less than 30) and the population standard deviation is unknown.\n",
    "2. The t-test assumes that the population follows a normal distribution, but it is more robust to violations of this assumption compared to the z-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Scenario: If you want to compare the average test scores of two groups of students (where the sample sizes are small), you would use a t-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Z-test:\n",
    "1. A z-test is used when the sample size is large (typically greater than 30) or when the population standard deviation is known.\n",
