    "Multiprocessing in Python is the technique of using multiple processors or cores to execute a program concurrently, allowing for parallel processing of tasks. This can be useful for computationally intensive tasks or for tasks that can be easily parallelized, such as data processing or scientific simulations."

    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing involves running multiple processes, each with its own memory space and interpreter, while multithreading involves running multiple threads within the same process and shared memory space. This means that multiprocessing can achieve true parallelism and avoid the limitations of the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), while multithreading is limited by the GIL and can only achieve concurrent execution."
