    "- Flattening images directly and inputting them into an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for image classification is not recommended due to several limitations and challenges.\n",

    "\n",
    "Extracting features from an image at the local level, rather than considering the entire image as a whole, is crucial for capturing spatial relationships, patterns, and details that contribute to object recognition and understanding. Here are the reasons why local feature extraction is important:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Spatial Heterogeneity: Images often contain objects or patterns that are not uniformly distributed across the entire image. By extracting features locally, the model can focus on relevant regions and ignore irrelevant background information, leading to more discriminative representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Translation Invariance: Local feature extraction helps achieve translation invariance, meaning the model can recognize objects regardless of their position or orientation within the image. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) utilize shared weights in convolutional layers to detect features across different spatial locations, enabling translation-invariant representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hierarchical Representation: Local features form the building blocks of hierarchical representations in deep learning models. By progressively combining local features at different scales and levels of abstraction, the model can learn complex, hierarchical representations of the input data, capturing both low-level details and high-level concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Robustness to Variations: Local feature extraction makes the model more robust to variations in scale, rotation, and viewpoint, as it can detect and encode relevant patterns and structures at multiple spatial resolutions."

    "- Convolutional operations apply learnable filters to input images, enabling the network to detect meaningful features such as edges, textures, and patterns.\n",
