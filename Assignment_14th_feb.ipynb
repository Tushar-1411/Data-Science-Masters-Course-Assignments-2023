    "Advantages of multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Improved performance: Multithreading can improve the performance of a program by allowing it to execute multiple tasks simultaneously. This can result in faster execution times and better resource utilization.\n",
    "2. Better responsiveness: Multithreading can help to make a program more responsive by allowing it to handle user input and other events concurrently.\n",
    "3. Easier to implement: Multithreading can be easier to implement than multiprocessing, as it does not require interprocess communication or shared memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Complexity: Multithreading can add complexity to a program, as it introduces the need to synchronize access to shared resources and avoid race conditions.\n",
    "2. Debugging and testing: Multithreaded programs can be more difficult to debug and test than single-threaded programs, as they have non-deterministic behavior and can exhibit race conditions.\n",
    "3. Overhead: Multithreading can introduce overhead in a program, as there is a cost associated with creating and managing threads. Additionally, if too many threads are used, this can result in a decrease in performance due to context switching and other overheads."

    "A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release a resource, such as a lock or a semaphore, that they need to proceed with their execution. This can result in a situation where none of the threads can make progress, and the program becomes stuck. Deadlocks are usually caused by improper resource management, such as holding a lock for too long or acquiring multiple locks in the wrong order.\n",

    "A race condition occurs when two or more threads access a shared resource concurrently, and the outcome depends on the timing of their execution. Race conditions can result in unexpected behavior, such as incorrect values or data corruption. Race conditions are usually caused by improper synchronization, such as not using locks or semaphores to protect shared resources."
